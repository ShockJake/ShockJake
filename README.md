### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stanislav, and i like programing.
Now I am studying at the Jagiellonian University on Applied Computer Science faculty.

Iâ€™m looking for a company to collaborate on, so I could gain experience to be a good programmer.

I have ended several courses of programming languages (Ð¡/Ð¡++,
Java, Python),
and I am happy to share some projects that I have done during
the classes and some of my own.
