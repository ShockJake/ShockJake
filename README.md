### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stanislav, and I am a programmer.
Currently, I am studying at the Jagiellonian University on Applied Computer Science faculty
and working in Sabre Polska.

In order to create my programs I use several languages (C/C++, Java and Python).
and I am happy to share some projects.
